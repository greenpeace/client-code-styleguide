**Do not edit the contents of HTML, Javascript or CSS in this folder unless you don't mind losing your changes the next time Grunt processes `src` documents**

This folder is intended to be used for testing partially-processed `src` documents.

It contains unminified Javascript and CSS to aid in debugging, as well as additional testing templates and example API responses in the JSON folder.
